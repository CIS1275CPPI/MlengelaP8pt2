# Web Research, Reading and Writing data files.

__Locate data on the web and convert it if necessary.__ __Write a program that reads the data, performs analysis on that data, and  writes a report to a file.__  __Here are the specific instructions for the program.__  __You must have located your data by now and had your proposal approved__

In addition, the final project should contain the following elements:

   * Your project cannot be a modified version of any program done as a programming assignment.
   * Conditional and looping structures must be included as part of your code.
   * Main will drive all other functions in your program – variables will be declared in main and passed to functions as needed; values will be returned to main and passed to other functions, as needed.
   * Pointers and/or references must be part of this final project.
   * This project must be **Multi-File** programming: driver in main(), function bodies in Functions.cpp, and prototypes in Functions.h (or your own filenames)
   * Your program will call a Read function that will read an input file that has **at least 25 data points.**
   * Your data will be stored in **arrays**.  There can be multiple parallel one-dimensional arrays, or, if you prefer, you may use a two or three-dimensional array.
   * Your program will then call an Analyze function (or maybe 3 functions) to analyze the data and produce three analytical values, or data facts, for your data.
   * Your program will then call a Write function, which will open a file, output your name, a description of the data, its location (URL),  and the results of your analysis to an external file (you can also write to the screen to check for correctness).  **The function should ask the user for the output file name.** __NOTE:__ Do not build your program so that it has any interaction with the user, other than asking for the output file name.  Text in your results file should be formatted for readability.
   * Include proper use of variables: declaration, initialization, and usage – avoid warnings.
   * Comments must be included in the program – describe what your program is doing.
   * Remember!  Between reading your data description document and your output file, I should have a good idea what your data and program were about.
   * **Testing: how will you know if your program output is “correct”? Explain to me why/how you are going to trust that your three analytical values are correct and accurate.   This may involve sample calculations or validation by inspection or independent calculations that verify your results.**
   * 	**Include a document in the project file to show the testing.**
